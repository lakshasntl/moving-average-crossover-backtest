# moving-average-crossover-backtest
This project implements and backtests a simple trading strategy based on moving average crossovers using historical stock price data. The goal is to evaluate how effective this strategy would have been over time and explore its potential risks and rewards.

## Problem Statement
Retail investors often use moving average (MA) indicators to make trading decisions. One popular approach is the Moving Average Crossover Strategy, where a short-term MA crossing above a long-term MA signals a buy, and a downward cross signals a sell.

Can this simple rule-based strategy outperform a passive "buy and hold" approach?
